# Can You Spell The News?
This is the official standardized test to determine if people of the world are: 1) Keeping up with the news, and 2) Good spellers

You probably will really struggle in life if you can't score at least 4 on this extremely important quiz (though, you may qualify to be President).  Not to mention, what else do we have to do besides watch/read news these days?

This was brutal.
